The Angular framework is great for building large-scale web applications that can be maintained and extended. And when you're building enterprise-level apps, testing is vital to the development process. Testing improves the quality of code and reduces maintenance, saving both time and money. Even though testing is crucial, it's sometimes neglected since there are few established resources and standards when it comes to modern JavaScript web applications. Developers who know how to build and leverage tests are highly valued by their clients and companies.

[Testing Angular Applications](https://www.manning.com/books/testing-angular-applications) is an example-rich, hands-on guide that gives you the real-world techniques you need to thoroughly test all parts of your Angular applications. You'll start with an introduction to Angular, TypeScript, testing fundamentals, and the testing frameworks and tools used in the book and begin writing your first tests. Next, you'll learn how to set-up your Angular environment, including TypeScript and the Angular dependencies and you'll create your first component. The second part of the book focuses on the most important concepts of Angular, such as testing components, directives, pipes, services, and routing. By the end of this book, you'll be able to confidently write unit and end-to-end tests for Angular applications in TypeScript.
